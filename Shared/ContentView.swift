/*
 We need:
 1. Squares in a grid
 2. Squares need to keep track of:
    - If they are owned by a player.
    - Which player owns them.
    - If they've been clicked on.
 3. A grid which understands the current layout of owned squares.
 4. A method for which to switch between Player 1 and Player 2.
    - This method also needs to alter which squares are handed out based on the current player.
 
 Systems include:
 - Squares
 - Grid
 - Memory
